Methods of token seperation:
-   Flank user-definables by reserved symbols (punctuation, operaters, whitespace, start of file, or end of file),
-   Start/end of neighbouring tokens have unique symbols (includes no overlap) (toggle),
-   Fixed number of start symbols with a distinguishing centre
-       (?? start section would be assumed to be part of this token, not the last one read. 
-       Potentially being confusing. Maybe allow this feature to be toggled)

user-definables cannot be reserved words

Approaches:
    Pure lexical analysis
    Grammar assisted analysis (will be a lot slower, but allows two tokens to have the same regex and be tokenised before syntax analysis)
